This is a PvE simple pong game made with raylib5 in c++.
The project is a visual studio project for Windows and the executables you may find inside are for X64 windows machines.
If your PC does not meet the criteria then you are going to have to build the source code and link it with raylib yourself.
The source code is contained in main.cpp and also the ball_and_paddle header file has been created that contains the structs used for the ball and the paddle.
The executable will ask the user for the difficulty of the AI and the colors of the background and ball and then start the actual game, which does not have a score limit.
Have fun <3.
